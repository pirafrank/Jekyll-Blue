Jekyll Blue is an overhauled fork of [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

It's developed as a quick but professional and full-featured way to create a personal website. It is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the popular static site generators.

Static site generators behaves like CMS but after local compiling they output plain static website in HTML and CSS. This way your website can be securely deployed on any server. Stop worrying about PHP-like exploits!

Jekyll Blue supports Github Pages. Read the [official doc](https://help.github.com/pages) and this wiki for further information.

## Features

All features of Jekyll-Now (credits to its author and its contributors), plus:

- All features without using plugins: 100% compatible with GitHub hosting!
- Completely redesigned home page
- Full-width navbar
- Website search
  - Powered by duckduckgo, so you don't have to worry about being tracked
- Automatic urls creation with redirect to enabled social networks
  - e.g. yourwebsite.com/twitter automatically redirects to your twitter account, yourwebsite.com/facebook to your facebook profile, and so on. Just you set up your social networks in _config.yml file
- Email obfuscation, so you don't get spam (yay!).
